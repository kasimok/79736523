# Placeholder Assets

This directory contains placeholder assets for the demo app. 

In a real project, you would replace these with actual:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png 
- adaptive-icon.png (for Android)
- favicon.png (for web)

For this demo focused on reproducing the iOS 18.5 video thumbnail issue, placeholder assets are sufficient.
